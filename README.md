Title of the project: Student Registration form using JPDB.


Description: The project uses JsonPowerDB by Login2Xplore as database. In this project we can add a student data in database named SCHOOL DB and table named as STUDENT TABLE. The user has to put Roll No as primary key if the roll number exists in the database it fetches the existing data and allows user to update the data. Save button is disabled in this case. If the Roll no does not exist int the database Change button is disabled and user is allowed to feed the data and saves into the database. Reset button clears all the fields and put the cursor back to the primary key i.e. Roll Number.

Benefits of JsonPowerDB: There are many benefits associated with the database such as it is fast, easy to use, development oriented, based on PowerIndex etc.
